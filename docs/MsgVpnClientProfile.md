**RejectMsgToSenderOnNoSubscriptionMatchEnabled** | **bool** | Enable or disable the sending of a negative acknowledgement on the discard of a guaranteed message. When a guaranteed message is published to a topic, and the router does not have any guaranteed subscriptions matching the message topic, the message can either be silently discarded, or a negative acknowledgement can be returned to the sender indicating that no guaranteed subscriptions were found for the message. It should be noted that even if the message is rejected to the publisher, it will still be delivered to any clients who have direct subscriptions to the topic. This configuration option does not affect the behavior of messages published to unknown queue names. That always results in the message being rejected to the sender. The default value is &#x60;false&#x60;. Available since 2.1.0. | [optional] [default to null]
**ReplicationAllowClientConnectWhenStandbyEnabled** | **bool** | Enable or disable whether clients using this client profile are allowed to connect to the Message VPN if its replication is in standby state. The default value is &#x60;false&#x60;. | [optional] [default to null]

This value may be higher than supported by the hardware. The default is the max value supported by the hardware. | [optional] [default to null]

**ServiceWebMaxConnectionCountPerClientUsername** | **int64** | The maximum number of web-transport connections that can be simultaneously connected with the same client-username. This value may be higher than supported by the hardware. The default is the max value supported by the hardware. | [optional] [default to null]
**ServiceWebMaxPayload** | **int64** | The maximum number of bytes allowed in a single web transport payload before fragmentation occurs, not including the header. The default value is &#x60;1000000&#x60;. | [optional] [default to null]
**TcpCongestionWindowSize** | **int64** | The TCP initial congestion window size for clients belonging to this profile.   The initial congestion window size is used when starting up a TCP connection or recovery from idle (that is, no traffic). It is the number of segments TCP sends before waiting for an acknowledgement from the peer. Larger values of initial window allows a connection to come up to speed quickly. However, care must be taken for if this parameter&#39;s value is too high, it may cause congestion in the network. For further details on initial window, refer to RFC 2581. Changing this parameter changes all clients matching this profile, whether already connected or not.   Changing the initial window from its default of 2 results in non-compliance with RFC 2581. Contact Solace Support personnel before changing this parameter. The default value is &#x60;2&#x60;. | [optional] [default to null]
**TcpKeepaliveCount** | **int64** | The number of keepalive probes TCP should send before dropping the connection. The default value is &#x60;5&#x60;. | [optional] [default to null]
**TcpKeepaliveIdleTime** | **int64** | The time (in seconds) a connection needs to remain idle before TCP begins sending keepalive probes. The default value is &#x60;3&#x60;. | [optional] [default to null]
**TcpKeepaliveInterval** | **int64** | The time between individual keepalive probes, when no response is received. The default value is &#x60;1&#x60;. | [optional] [default to null]
**TcpMaxSegmentSize** | **int64** | The TCP maximum segment size for the clients belonging to this profile. The default value is &#x60;1460&#x60;. | [optional] [default to null]
**TcpMaxWindowSize** | **int64** | The TCP maximum window size (in KB) for clients belonging to this profile. Changes are applied to all existing connections. The maximum window should be at least the bandwidth-delay product of the link between the TCP peers. If the maximum window is less than the bandwidth-delay product, then the TCP connection operates below its maximum potential throughput. If the maximum window is less than about twice the bandwidth-delay product, then occasional packet loss causes TCP connection to operate below its maximum potential throughput as it handles the missing ACKs and retransmissions. There are also problems with a maximum window that&#39;s too large. In the presence of a high offered load, TCP gradually increases its congestion window until either (a) the congestion window reaches the maximum window, or (b) packet loss occurs in the network. Initially, when the congestion window is small, the network&#39;s physical bandwidth-delay acts as a memory buffer for packets in flight. As the congestion window crosses the bandwidth-delay product, though, the buffering of in-flight packets moves to queues in various switches, routers, etc. in the network. As the congestion window continues to increase, some such queue in some equipment overflows, causing packet loss and TCP back-off. The default value is &#x60;256&#x60;. | [optional] [default to null]
